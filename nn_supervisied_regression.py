# Whatever comes between these layers are called as hidden layers, \
# these are the deep belifs networks giving rise to deep learning.

#       Synapses take a value from their input and multiply it by a \
#       specific weight and output the result.
#       Neurons on the other hand add all the output form their \
#       synapses and apply an activation function.

# As the above equation is derived from 1,2,3, and 4, thus
#    J = sum(1/2*(y - f(f(xW1)W2))^2)
# What is the rate of change of J with respect to W, also kown as the \
# deretive(dJ/dW) since we are considering one weight at a time this \
# is partial derevative. 
# If dJ/dW is positive then the cost function is going up.
# If dJ/dW is negative then the cost function is going down.
# When going down, stopping at lowest min. is called  Gradient Descent.
